# React Marvel App
We are going to build a Marvel comic character explorer using the awesome [Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com/)!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). <br>
You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).<br>
For more info on React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).


## Getting Started

This repo is meant to be used in tandem with the in-class notes. We will be starting from the initial Create React App project files and creating our own app to explore the characters of the Marvel comic universe!

The in-class tutorial will guide you through the steps to do this, but if you get lost at any point, this repo also provides branches at different checkpoints that you can check out to catch up.


## Scripts

We will make use of some of the scripts Creact React App provides us to get started. In the root folder of your project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. When we are working on our app, we will run this script to kick off a local development server so that we can test our changes as we go.<br>
Once you run `npm start` open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
